				<story>The Activision Decathlon is a series of Olympic games similar to the Epyx games series. Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race. ****The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.****For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</story>

				<story>Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game.  On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen.  The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.****In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft.  You are stationary.   Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.  ****In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen.  Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.** **In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again.  This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits).  The controls are as in games 1-6.  ****In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above.  Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed.  When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.  ****In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below.  The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18.  The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.  ****In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.****Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets.  I have yet to see this happen.)  In each of the single player games, the single player tries to outscore a computer opponent that simply constantly fires.</story>

When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.****The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.****Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. ****Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.****Game Difficulty and Variations**There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. ****The game also offers three different game variations:****1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.****2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.****3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.****Scoring**The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.****1. Small saucer - 1,000 points**2. Other player's ship - 500 points**3. Large saucer - 200 points**4.

While letting a meteor get past you will only lower your score, you have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, you will lose a life.

As you ""rob"" each of the banks, they disappear, and a police car appears in its place, beginning hot pursuit after a few moments.  You must avoid the cops to stay alive.  Fortunately you are not completely defenseless, as you have a stock of dynamite, which you can strategically drop to destroy the cop cars.****Besides the escape tunnel that will take you from one side of the screen to another (as in Pac-Man), there is an additional tunnel that represents the road out of town.  By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city.  Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.****There are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.  Therefore, the goal of the game is to drive from town to town, navigating the mazes of streets, and robbing as many of the banks in each town as you are able to.

In the harder game, once the ball is released you no longer can control its direction. There are also two difficulty levels which control how difficult it is to get a strike.</story>

In the novice game, you will be able to see your partners hand while bidding while in the expert game your partners hand remains hidden. For each game, you can choose to play to either 13, 21, 25, or 29 points. After a hand is finished, you have the option of replaying the same hand if you want to practice, or you can have the computer deal a new hand. If you don't like the way a hand is going, you have the option of restarting the hand to try again. Included with the game instructions is a complete guide to how your computer partner will bid in different situations in order to help you form your strategy. Bridge was designed for people who already know how to play the game, it won't teach you how to play.</story>

To help out, a long range scanner is located at the bottom of the screen which can locate trucks in the convoy as well as enemy aircraft. Good luck, the ground troops are counting on you!</story>

				<story>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</story>

				<story>In Codebreaker your goal is to guess a 3 or 4 digit secret code which is generated by either the computer or another player. Depending on the difficulty setting, the player has either 8 or 12 guesses to figure out the code by entering in values with the keyboard controller. After each guess, the computer analyzes your input and displays results which indicate if you have a correct digit in the correct position, a correct digit in the wrong position, or no correct digits at all. Points are scored based on how many turns it takes to correctly identify the code. A second game variation called Nim is also included. In this game, two players take turns removing items from a stack. On each turn, a player must take at least one item from a stack, and the player who removes the last item from the screen wins. You can have the computer set up the stacks automatically or set them up manually, and a variation is included where the player who removes the last item from the screen loses rather than wins.</story>

As the captain of the Ark, the player will have to contend with deadly meteor storms and planetary defense systems to succeed the mission.Cosmic Ark features two play screens: On the first, the player will have to blast meteors with four-way cannons. Blast enough and the player can go on to the second screen. The Ark descends low over one of Alpha Ro's planets. The player will then have to guide a shuttle craft down and beam aboard two creatures, while avoiding any laser defense system that may be in operation. The player will have to get the creatures back on board quickly, because another meteor shower could happen at any moment. Then it's off to the next planet!</story>

First, you must successfully land the rocket module on the planet surface (this contains your astrobus). This part of the game is similar to the game Lunar Lander; you must control the speed of the lander to make sure you don't crash! In the second, horizontally scrolling segment you control the astrobus and attempt to pick up the commuters at the bus stops. Once all of the commuters are picked up, return to the rocket module and take off to transport the commuters to the grand central space station. Of course, there are many obstacles which can prevent a successful mission. Meteors, fireballs and space mines all get in the way and can destroy your astrobus. Your astrobus is equipped with a laser that can be used to destroy these obstacles. The astrobus also has a limited amount of fuel; if you start running out you better find more fuel before you crash!</story>

You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little moreThe second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.</story>

				<story>Dark Chambers is an arcade action game similar to Gauntlet. You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can. Hidden somewhere in each of the levels is an exit which will take you on to the next level. Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.</story>

				<story>You have been sent to deliver a message. Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.Game variationsAfter you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.The difficulty settings are:Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.The difficulty switches are not used.After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.ScoringReadiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.Destroy the left or right generator=2000 pointsDestroy the center generator=5000 pointsShield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</story>

You burn fuel as your drive and burn faster when you use overdrive. Each time you black out an section, you gain points and fuel. If you black out two sections at once, you gain more fuel.

The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</story>

As you swim away from the squid, you will encounter schools of sea horses which form a vertical row on the screen with only a small opening to swim through. As you approach each school, the dolphins sonar will help you locate the opening; a low pitched sound will indicate the opening is near the bottom of the screen, and a higher pitched sound indicates the opening is near the top. If you miss the opening, the dolphin will lose speed allowing the squid to catch up to you! From time to time, a seagull may fly overhead; if you jump out of the water and touch the seagull, your dolphin will temporarily be able to chase the squid. Throughout the ocean are waves which are indicated by arrows; an arrow pointing the same direction you are travelling will boost the dolphins speed, whereas an arrow pointing the opposite direction slows you down.

				<story>"Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally ""Jumpman"") and Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out.  Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.  From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, ""living"" fireballs, and spring-weights.  Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time.  Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted."</story>

In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</story>

Heading to the dragon's lair, the Druid accidentally dropped the amulet and it fell deep into its lair. Over time, the amulet imbued the dragon with cunning and power so that it began to spread treachery and evil about the peaceful Kingdom.

Taking up the call to arms, the player begins by gathering their strength and fighting creatures in the enchanted countryside to build up enough power to become a Dragonstomper. When finally ready, the player moves on to an oppressed village near the dragon's lair in order to recruit soldiers, buy magical scrolls, and acquire medicines and elixirs needed to face the dragon in its lair. With all of his skills, training, equipment and soldiers, the Dragonstomper descends into the dragon's lair for a final combat to bring peace to the Kingdom.</story>

				<story>Dragster is a drag racing simulation for one or two players. The object of the game is to be the first car to race across the screen in the two player game, or to race across the screen in the shortest possible time in a one player game. The joystick acts as both the gas peddle and clutch; you have the ability to shift from first through fourth, but be careful not to shift too soon because you can't downshift! You must also be careful not to rev your engine too much, or you'll blow your engine and be out of the race. There are two game variations included; in the simpler game, you just need to drive straight to reach the goal. In the advanced variation, you also have the ability to steer and need to keep your car driving straight between the bleachers and road divider.</story>

				<story>Dukes of Hazzard  was a prototype that was never released, The game starts by default on level 0, but you can choose to start on any level from 0 to 10.  The object of the game is pretty straightforward: you must traverse up through Hazzard county (a layout of nearly 11 screens) and reach the jail before Boss Hog catches up with Daisy, as shown at the top of the screen.  Pushing UP applies the gas and LEFT/RIGHT controls the steering. Rosco (in his police car) chases you throughout the county in an effort to stop you (you���ll hear his police siren when he���s near); if caught, you���ll lose one of your 4 cars, and start over at the bottom of the course.  Nails can be found along the way and used to temporarily disable Rosco���s cruiser.  However, they can damage your car���s tires just as easily, so you must drive very slowly over them to safely pick them up.  Pressing the FIRE button drops the nails.  You have another advantage in that your car can move diagonally (Rosco���s can���t).  A good tip for the higher levels is to keep his car in sight behind you while moving up.  If he scrolls off the screen, he���ll possibly reappear right in front of you!</story>

E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces scattered around in order to regain energy which is constantly depleted with time. The phone pieces are in some of the pits, and E.T. must jump in to get them; sometimes there's also a dead flower in the pit which provides extra points if brought back to life. Once E.T. has done his business in the pit, to get out he must levitate his way out, though he must watch out not to fall into the pit again after leaving.

You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</story>

He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrowMaze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequenceMaze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit onceMaze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.Atari 2600 Difficulty SwitchesThe difficulty switch on the left controls the number of chances you get.A=5 chancesB=9 chancesThe difficulty switch on the right controls the Alien Stalker's speed.A=FastB=Slow</story>

				<story>Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.</story>

				<story>After your interplanetary craft accidentally enters a black hole, you find yourself in a different universe. This world is inhabited by strange, mechanical bug-like creatures. You find that this world contains both bad and good bugs; the good bugs have asked for your help, and you agree to defend them. Your first challenge is to rescue the Pixy; this is the last living creature on the planet and is guarded by a killer bee. Should you succeed, you next will need to fight off a variety of enemy creatures including a flaming pumpkin, demons, and coiled serpents. Each time you defeat the creatures on the screen, you can move to the right where a new challenge (and bonus) awaits! After you complete all of the screens of bad bugs, then the game repeats at a tougher difficulty level.</story>

				<story>Fireball is an arcade action game similar to Breakout. You are a juggler, and you need to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. You can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if you try to catch a third it wall fall off the screen. Your goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, you move on to the next round and are given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, you will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.Marching Blocks: In this game, each time you catch a fireball the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that you need to destroy.Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move! Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation! When you destroy enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</story>

Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.</story>

There will be two beeps to warn you of the shield leaving.The scoring is as follows:10 points = Debris25 points = Patrol Ship70 points = Rescued Spaceman100 points = Disrupter GeneratorYou get 100 points for killing the first warrior at a pod, 200 for the second, 300 for the third and so on.You lose 1,000 points if you shoot a spaceman, but Flash Gordon would never do that, right?Every time you conquer a city, you get an extra man.</story>

The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.</story>

				<story>"Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who will ""bust"" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated ""proton packs"" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for ""ghost alarms"" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer."</story>

				<story>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.Difficulty switchesUse the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.Game variationsThere are five games, each with five skill levels.The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.Skill levels for one player games:Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)Skill level 2=132 secondsSkill level 3=39 secondsSkill level 4=26 secondsSkill level 5=random timesFor two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.The games are:Game 1 (Billboard): After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.Game 2 (Skill Builder): Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.Game 3 (Times Up): You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.Game 4 (Encore): The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.Game 5 (Over the Edge): Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</story>

Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading ""towards"" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge."</story>

With each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.</story>

You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</story>

				<story>"Your character starts at the lower left of a multi-tiered screen and must make his way to the beautiful(?) woman to the right, however you'll soon find out that someone is out to stop your stud monkey conquests at all costs.  The first obstacle you'll encounter takes the form of a sniper hiding in a bush.  Why would a sniper be hiding in a bush just to shoot you in the buttocks?  Why not?  As you approach the bush a bullet will fly out in your direction, killing you if it makes contact.  To get past the sniper, simply run away a few times until he has to reload (the bullets will stop) and then run past the bush.  Once you're past the bush, you can run into your lady's loving arms and explore a different kind of bush��� Each time you make it to one of the women, you will start the ""humping"" mini-game.  Your goal here is to meet her thrusts by pushing right every time she thrusts her pelvis.  If you're successful in your timing you will score a point and a tone will sound.  Each time you score a point, the tone will get higher and higher indicating that danger is approaching.  If you continue to ""score"" past a certain point (around 8 or so points) your woman will appear to explode and you will fall into a pit and die (I guess you were a little too much for her).  To avoid this, make sure you push the button to escape before this happens.  If you manage to score 69 points you will earn an extra life.The next obstacle you must face comes in the form of a river.  While conceptually this is the easiest obstacle to clear, the iffy collision detection makes it much more difficult than it should be.  To clear the river, simply run towards to it and push the button when your back foot is on the edge of the bank (not your front foot).  Assuming you timed it right, you will go flying over the river and meet yet another woman.  You know what to do���After you've scored as many points as you dare, you will be taken to the next area of the screen.  Here you must run past a dangerous fire breathing dragon, which is much more difficult than it sounds.  The trick to getting past the dragon is to wait for it to breathe fire, then quickly run by him.  Once you're past the dragon you'll undoubtedly notice the large pit ahead of you.  Here you must wait for the snake to change into a woman and then quickly drop down into the pit to ""do the deed"".  The timing on this is rather tricky as you can't simply wait around for the snake to change because the dragon is chasing you.  If you manage to time it just right and find the woman, you'll be taken to the last area of the game.In this final area you must chase down the woman running around the top of the castle as they aren't just going to wait around for you anymore.  As you chase your dream date, you'll notice that ugly little faces appear to be puking on you.  These are actually gargoyles, and they're trying to dump lava on you.  The gargoyles are easily avoided by stopping when they breathe fire, and since there are no other dangers on this level, you're free to stop and start the pursuit at will.  Each time you catch the woman you can score a few points in the standard manner, but she'll run away again and the chase continues���"</story>

				<story>Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the  four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter so be careful! You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score!</story>

				<story>The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base. The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</story>

				<story>In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position, angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will make your timing more critical.</story>

				<story>Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player more of an advantage.</story>

Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out.

There are tricycles, kites, drums, balloons, trains, root beers, and other bonuses that appear as the levels progress. When the bonus items bounce around the screen, any dots they touch will become larger and are now worth 50 points each instead of 10. However, one of these larger dots will cause Jr. Pac-Man to slow down greatly when he eats them making it more difficult to remain one step ahead of the ghosts which constantly pursue him!

The crystal spider along with strands of the web make maneuvering your way around this screen a challenge. Once you know the correct path, you ride on to the Black Fortress. Here you need to use the Glaives you've collected to free the Princess from a prison, and then destroy the beast!  After successfully completing all tasks, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</story>

				<story>Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields.</story>

				<story>During WWII German bombers turned daily existence in London into a nightmare. Most bombs exploded on impact but some would sit for hours, days or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a Lance Corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is your job to defuse these bombs.First, you will check your London map to see where the bombs are. Then it is defusing time. On the C64, you must use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, you must change it again and keep trying. On the Atari 2600, you slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle the middle and the bottom the right.You set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, what slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb and on blue bombs, you can't control the switches. They just randomly change and you push right and hope you disarm in time.The possible ranks are:Lance CorporalCorporalSargentStaff SargentWarrant OfficerSecond LieutenantFirst LieutenantCaptainAt the start of the game, you can select which rank to start at, from Lance Corporal to Second Lieutenant on the C64 or from Lance Corporal to First Lieutenant on the Atari 2600. Every time you disarm a bomb, you move up levels within your rank. Move up eight levels and you are promoted. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, you are demoted a level in rank.You lose the game is you are demoted below Lance Corporal or a bomb explodes while you are near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen.You win if you get promoted to Captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</story>

Unlike Black Knight, however, David's Midnight Magic contains a mixture of bright colors. Featuring dual flipper controls, upper and lower playing fields, tilt mechanism, multiple ball play, electromagnetic deflectors, and many special effects, the game represents the first generation of home computer pinball simulations available with relatively realistic pinball features.</story>

But there are other insects as well; spiders, bees, dragonflies and earwigs. Nature is dangerous. Luckily, there's a bug zapper that can shoot arrows at these insects and destroy them.Millipede is the sequel to Centipede, and features similar gameplay, but with a new swarm of insects! The goal is to destroy the multi-segmented millipede as it traverses its way through the mushroom forest towards the bottom of the screen. When all millipede segments have been destroyed, the player will progress to the next, more difficult level. Millipedes and other creatures are all worth a different amount of points. Occasionally dynamite will appear on the screen, which will explode if shot by the bug zapper. With a well timed shot, numerous millipede segments (and other insects as well) can be taken out as they pass by.</story>

When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a canon!) Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bobs way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed! There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as figure out a unique strategy for each level.</story>

Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup.  The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it.  So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit.

Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

				<story>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</story>

				<story>"In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the ""eat the dots/avoid the ghosts"" gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of ""Junior""."</story>

It is a pretty decent little game with some nice graphics of the golfer and even two different views of the greens.  You get the option of switching clubs and you have the power bar to gauge how hard you hit it. If you like golf games, then this will be a welcome addition to your  collection.

You need to catch this to replenish your air before it runs out (if you run out of air, some treasure will be lost). The game ends when you have lost all of your treasure.</story>

You control Kung Fu Lu, whose mission is to destroy a mysterious, evil wall by reflecting a bouncing ball into the bricks that make up the wall. When the bricks are hit by the ball, they are destroyed. On the top of the screen is a mystical dragon which guards the wall. Each level can be completed by either destroying all of the bricks in the wall, or hitting the dragon six times with the ball. Once the first level is completed, a blackbird will also appear on screen just below the wall. The blackbird will deflect the ball, and tries to get in the way to make your mission more difficult. From time to time, a magic token will fall downward which gives you special powers if caught. These can make the ball magnetic and follow your player, give you a larger paddle, or make the ball explosive and take out larger chunks of bricks. You start the game at a skill level of Peasant, and advance in rank every time four waves of bricks are cleared. You lose a life every time the ball falls off the bottoms of the screen, and the game ends when you lose all five of your lives.</story>

While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.Bouncing also comes into play during movement.  When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.

				<story>Panda Chase is a strange game where, controlling a panda, you should go through the various levels of the game looking for bamboos to recover your energy that is lost every second.When the game begins, the panda will be in an open area with many places to explore. Once you get somewhere, you will appear in a new environment, is a cave, forest or open field. Your goal will go through the obstacles and dodge the enemies to get your bamboo.To catch a bamboo player will recover your energy and get points. If you run out points or lose your three lives, the game will end.Apparently Panda Chase is not a prototype, the game was finished and sold, which does not justify the graphics and several bugs that happen in the game.</story>

				<story>rachute (aka Von Himmel durch die Hoelle) is a video game released in 1983 by Homevision for the Atari 2600. The game puts the player in the role of parachutist who is falling gently from the sky. In order to land safely, the player must evade aeroplanes, helicopters, birds and hot air balloons. After successfully navigating several screens that progressively increase in speed, the parachutist finally emerges near ground level. In order to achieve a safe landing, the player must simultaneously avoid touching the pacing guard at the bottom while positioning the parachuter on the ground. A higher point bonus is awarded if the parachuter lands near the center of the screen. After landing, the game begins again at an increased difficulty level.</story>

				<story>In Phaser Patrol you are the pilot of an interstellar spaceship on a mission to defend the Human Federation from the deadly Dracon armada. Gameplay is similar to Star Raiders. You begin with a view of the sector map, and need to warp to a sector where the Dracon are located. Once you've reached your destination, the game switches to a first person point of view where you need to destroy all enemy fighters located in the sector. Once the sector is cleared, you can return to the sector map and warp to a new location. The mission is successful when all sectors containing enemy fighters have been cleared. Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).  The game is timed, and the faster you can complete your mission the better your ranking at the end will be!</story>

				<story>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</story>

				<story>In this remake of the arcade game Pooyan from the early '80s, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.  The first screen takes place near the pigs' home.  Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground.  If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.  But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.The wolves shoot acorns at the pig.  But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too.  If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)The second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.</story>

				<story>Popeye is a conversion of the arcade action/platform game. As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love! She is at the top of the screen dropping tokens of her love, and you need to collect them before they hit the ground. After you have collected the required number of items, you can move on to the next, more difficult level. There are many obstacles trying to stop you from completing your task, though! Brutus wanders around the screen and is constantly trying to catch you. If you collect a can of spinach, you can temporarily knock him out, otherwise Brutus will knock you out. Other objects such as bottles or birds are also flying around the screen and will cause you to lose one of your lives if you are hit. Each level features a different layout of platforms and ladders, and will have you collecting different items as they float towards the bottom of the screen!</story>

				<story>You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases, several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and how high you can jump.</story>

				<story>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</story>

				<story>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.</story>

To make the game more challenging, you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease.

You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</story>

				<story>In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom).  If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there.   Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!</story>

				<story>Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!</story>

				<story>Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</story>

You begin with a top-down view if the F-117, facing towards the bottom of the screen. Meteors and later space pirates come from the bottom moving up and you must shoot them. After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them. They are Terra I's last defensive line so when you get through them, you win.In the two player games, player one controls the F-117's left and right movement and player two controls the up and down movement therefore players must work together.

				<story>You're the pilot of an F-14 assault jet, assigned to the dangerous mission of taking out an enemy bridge at the top of a heavily guarded river. In River Raid II, the gameplay is similar to the original River Raid, but with a few additions. For each mission you start out on an aircraft carrier. After a successful takeoff, you need to get past enemy forces located over the ocean which guard the entrance to the river. Make sure to collect plenty of fuel from the refueling jets, since once you reach the river fuel will become scarce! Next you will have to make your way up the treacherous river channel until you finally reach, and hopefully destroy, the bridge. But the level isn't over yet, for now  you have to return to the aircraft carrier and land safely. After completing all of this, you move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to the expanded levels, another change in River Raid II is the ability to control the altitude of your plane. You can fly high above everything, or fly low into the channel to take out enemy tanks and barges.</story>

Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</story>

The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to ""shake"" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places."</story>

				<story>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</story>

After the second player is hidden, the first player needs to locate him in the shortest time possible. After the second player has been located, the roles will then be reversed. The game takes place in an old house with three rooms available as well as the front yard to hide in; each of these four locations contains five different places to hide. The game can be played with fixed or variable hiding locations; in the fixed game, the hiding locations will always be found in the same place, and the variable game will move the hiding places around each time a room is entered. Two difficulty levels are available; in the tougher setting, the entrance to the hiding places is narrower making it tougher to find.</story>

				<story>Earth is under attack from rows of bomb dropping aliens, and you need to defend it! The rows of aliens begin at the top of the screen, and you control a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to earn points by shooting the aliens before they can land. The aliens march back and forth, and each time the end of the screen is reached they will drop one row closer to the bottom. Shoot them all, and you move on to the next (tougher) level, but if even one of them lands the game is over. From time to time a flying saucer will pass by along the top of the screen; shoot this to earn extra points. Just above your laser canon are three shields; these can be used to hide from the alien's bombs, but will also block your own shots. You begin the game with a limited number of laser canons, and if all of them are bombed the game ends.</story>

				<story>Space Jockey is a side scrolling shooter for one player. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by having your attack saucer shoot down the varied enemies which fly by. Tanks, jet planes, prop planes, helicopters, weather balloons, and even some trees and houses will all pass by on the screen and try to destroy your saucer. You need to make sure you avoid colliding with the various enemies and their fire or one of your three saucers will be lost. Extra saucers are awarded for each 1000 points earned. Several game variations are included which control the game difficulty, the movement abilities of the enemies, and the movement abilities of your saucer.</story>

				<story>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</story>

Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</story>

				<story>Spike's Peak is an action game where you need to climb to the top of a mountain! Gameplay takes place on five different screens. The first screen shows you approaching the mountain; you begin here each time you start a game or lose a life. All you need to do is walk up the path to begin the stage you've reached so far. Flags by the path indicate how many lives you have left. The next screen is a zig zag path through meadows at the base of the mountain. Beware of the deadly bears and eagles here! Along the path are several caves which you can hide in when a bear or eagle appears (you can also jump over bears). The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge. Boulders and falling pieces of rock constantly appear and can knock you back down the screen. Next is the icy cap of the mountain. Climb up to the top without being knocked down by avalanches or getting caught by the abominable snowman. The last screen takes place at the mountain summit where you need to climb to the top and plant a flag before freezing! Complete all of these screens and you win the game. There are four different difficulty levels available.</story>

A row of blocks turns white when they all of have been destroyed; the row will then begin growing again, but you will now longer be able to shoot the blocks! When all of the rows have been changed to white, you will move on to the next level. The third (and final) game variation included is similar to the second one, except that the wall behind you will also move inwards; Your goal is still to shoot your way through the left wall before the right wall catches up to you.

There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</story>

Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</story>

				<story>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match! Several game options are included which control the speed of the seeker, or even make the seeker invisible.</story>

				<story>"Death Star Battle is loosely based on the events of ""Star Wars, Part 6: Return of the Jedi"". Your task is to destroy the Death Star before its construction is finished. You start the task outside the shield perimeter of the Death Star. There you'll have to combat different imperial vessels and avoid the death ray while waiting for an opportunity to slip through one of the random openings in the energy shield. After reaching the Death Star you must reduce its structure up to the point where you can hit the core. In the following blow up of the station you must avoid collision with Death Star debris.After successful destruction the game will restart with increased difficulty (faster enemies, faster Death Star build up, etc).Overall difficulty can also be adjusted before starting the game."</story>

				<story>Conversion of Atari Games' first-person shoot 'em up based around the original Star Wars film. You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star - which, as any fan knows, involves attacking the 'weak spot' near the exhaust. To even get to this you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty. The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.</story>

As the pilot of a snowspeeder, you need to take out as many of the walkers as you can. The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located. If a walker reaches the power generator, or you run out of snowspeeders the game is over. Good luck, and may the force be with you!</story>

The task is still rescuing humanoids before Landers can turn them into Mutants, while avoiding and shooting other foes, however you must now carry humanoids to safety through the Stargate of the title. Entering this Stargate not only warps you to the nearest humanoid in jeopardy, but can also warp you ahead (while on the first 15 levels) if you enter it with 4 or more humanoids, and give you extra lives if you warp with 10 humanoids, so there is a trade-off between guaranteeing the safety of existing humanoids, and trying to advance your positionThere are more enemies on screen than ever before.

				<story>A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases.   In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</story>

You can move in any direction but cannot shoot straight left or right. You can shoot in any other direction, however. After you get past the drones, three shields form near the bottom of the screen. Also, interceptor and patrol ships appear.

Be warned, though, that once there is a hole in the shield, the command crawler will shoot through it to destroy you. The crawler tries to stay below you but it is slow.

The first is 'Breakout', and plays the same as the original game. This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the top. The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.</story>

				<story>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</story>

The sets of numbers, for instance 16-4, were actually a combination of a page number and a panel number in the comic book that came with the game.

				<story>Title Match is a wrestling game which can be played by one or two players. There are four different wrestlers you can choose from, and two modes of gameplay (one on one, or tag team). Each wrestler can kick, punch, and perform several moves such as the airplane spin, body slam, power lift, and more. Using the available moves you need to deplete your opponents energy  and pin him for three counts (though be careful, as some of the more powerful moves also use up a bit of your own energy). If your opponents energy is low enough and you successfully pin him that will count as a fall, and the best out of three falls will win the match!</story>

You play until the time runs out then you get bonus points depending on weather you lost any teeth and how many. Occasionally, Snack Attack will try to swoop down and grab you. If you are caught, you lose a man. If one or more of your teeth are in danger of being lost, indicated by it flashing, you can press your fire button to Reach toothbrush, Johnson & Johnson dental  floss and Act fluoride dental rinse to save that/those tooth/teeth.

Your goal is to rescue as many survivors as possible from the many floors of the building. On each floor, your fire fighter begins at the bottom of the screen and needs to reach the top where the survivors have taken cover. Blocking your path are numerous (and dangerous) fires. Your fire fighter is equipped with a hose and an unlimited water supply to help you put out the fires. You need to be quick, however, for if you take too long the survivors will die! When you rescue as many survivors as you can and make it back out of the room, the floor is complete and a helicopter will transport you to the next floor. Although it isn't necessary to put out all of the fires on a floor, you will earn bonus points if you do. The higher you get in the building, the tougher the game becomes.

Therefore, the playfield is a colorful, three-dimensional maze, so you never see yourself... just the walls on either side of you that form the corridors you travel along.  As you move along the passage-ways, additional tunnels appear on either side, which you can turn into by pressing left and right.Your primary goal is to locate and collect the hidden key, located in a different spot within each maze.  Through the assistance of a MAP, you can maneuver within the maze.  While attempting to locate the key to exit the level, you must also avoid the hungry Zot���s.  You will discover these enemy creatures throughout the maze.  Successfully recovering the key without being intercepted by the Zot's opens the portal to the next level.  As you pass each level, you will discover that the complexity and difficulty increases, while your MAP gradually reveals less and less information��� ultimately, your map will be of little use, requiring you to survive solely by instincts and quick thinking!"</story>

				<story>Turmoil is a fast-paced shooter. You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels.  Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels.  You are not alone, however.  A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you.  Therefore, the ultimate objective of ���Turmoil��� is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by.  Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day!  As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side.  Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long.  If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.The enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds.  The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them.  Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel.  This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway.  In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it.  If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points.  If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way. When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships.  If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship.  In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time.  You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens.  There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.  This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.</story>

Your goal is to pilot your spaceship to the City of Mystery which is located at the end of a heavily guarded tunnel, and once there destroy the creature Gond. The tunnel is broken up into several different zones, called the mountain zone, rainbow zone, stick zone, stripe zone, bleak zone, and City of Mystery. Each zone features different types of enemy spaceships to deal with, and can scroll either horizontally or vertically. In the mountain zone or stripe zone, you may also come across an energy pod marked with an 'E'. If you fly through this, your ship temporarily becomes invincible to the deadly cave walls and numerous enemies which are trying to stop you. When not invincible, your space ship is equipped with lasers to help destroy enemies. You can fire in four different directions, however your speed is decreased when firing. You also need to keep an eye on your fuel gauge; your fuel will deplete at a rapid rate, and your ship will crash if it runs out. Fuel is gained each time you destroy an enemy, so make sure you destroy as many as you can! When you finally make it through all the various zones of the tunnel and defeat Gond, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</story>

				<story>This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square.  To carry out the en passant, you must advance yourpawn to the fifth rank.  Your opponent then has the option of movinghis or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or twosquares.  If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.Skill levelsThese determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.Level 1=15 secondsLevel 2=30 secondsLevel 3=45 secondsLevel 4=2 minutes, 45 secondsLevel 5=3 minutes, 15 secondsLevel 6=12 minutesLevel 7=10 hoursLevel 8=10 secondsLevel 8 is a beginner level.</story>

A few of these variations are:1. Foozpong: Each player controls multiple paddles which are arranged somewhat like a foozball table.2. Soccer pong: Each player controls two paddles (representing one goalie and one player) and the goal is much narrower.3. Hockey pong: The playfield is set up to resemble hockey; the goal isn't at the very edge of the screen, so the ball may bounce behind and around the goal.4. Quadrapong: The goals are located along the top, right, bottom, and left sides of the screen. This game is played by four players, two per team with one person defending each of the four goals.5. Handball pong: There is no goal, and two players take turns hitting the ball against a solid wall to earn points. One point is earned each time your opponent is unable to return the ball.6. Volleyball pong: The screen is set up like a volleyball court with a "net" in the middle. Both players are along the bottom of the screen and need to bounce the ball past their opponent.7. Basketball pong: Each player controls a paddle on the bottom of the screen, and attempts to hit the ball into their opponents basket at the top.</story>

At the bottom of the screen the player has a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible.When the the player completes a maze, a Worluk sometimes appears. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If the player destroys the creature before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points. Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quickly and can teleport around the maze. If they destroy him, the player will earn a large amount of points.The game may be played by one player or two players simultaneously.</story>

				<story>In Word Zapper your goal is to zap three words in 99 seconds. First, the current word will appear at the bottom of the screen. You then have to recreate this word by controlling your spaceship and zapping letters in the correct order which will be scrolling by at the top of the screen. To make this task more challenging, various asteroids will fly by horizontally; some asteroids will cause you to lose time, others destroy your ship ending the game. To help protect yourself, your spaceship is also equipped with lasers which can be used to destroy the asteroids. If you shoot five asteroids in a row, you earn a "freebie" which can be used in place of any letter. You will also need to use the "freebie" to move on to the next word after all the necessary letters have been zapped. The game ends when you successfully zap three words, the time limit runs out, or your spaceship is destroyed by asteroids. Numerous game variations are available. These control the speed and density of the asteroids, the speed of the scrolling alphabet, and allow you to choose between zapping words or random letters.</story>

Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged.

For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.****For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</story>

You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per level.

Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance. Occassionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator it will turn into an enemy!</story>

To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start butt</story>

To do this, you must walk over each segment of the framework in the mines. To reach each segment of framework, you will need to figure out a way to jump, climb, or use one of the many devices occasionally available to get there. To you help you get around (or sometimes hinder progress) are ladders, slides, suction tubes, cannons, transporters, and other devices. Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants. If you come in contact with one of these, you will lose a life. Scattered throughout each mine are special food items; collect one of these, and you will temporarily be able to eliminate the mutants by walking into them. You will need to figure out a unique strategy for each level in order to complete it, plus there is a time limit so claim all the territory quickly!</story>

				<story>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. ****The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. ****Insect Opponents and Mushrooms**All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:****1. The Centipede**The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.****Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.****The Spider**The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.****The Flea**The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.****The Scorpion**The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.****Mushrooms**Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.****Game Difficulty and Variations**The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:****1. One Player**Two Player Alternating**Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.**Dual Player Competition**Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.**Team Play**Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.****Scoring**The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:****Centipede Head - 100 points**Centipede Body Segment - 10 points**Spider at close range - 900 points**Spider at medium range - 600 points**Flea - 200 points**Scorpion - 1,000 points**Flea - 200 points**Restored mushroom - 5 points**Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</story>

From a top down point of view, you control a tank over varied, scrolling terrain. To stop the missiles, you have two options: you can destroy all of the missiles, or attempt to guess the fail safe code. If you try to destroy all the missiles, you must do so in under ten minutes. The missiles silos have many defenses which the terrorists also control; pillboxes, tanks, jeeps, and cruise missiles are all capable of destroying your tank. Should you attempt to guess the fail safe code, clues can be found by docking at supply depots. The code is three letters long, and can consist of any combination of L, E and O. When you enter a war room, you have a very short time to enter the code correctly or the missiles will launch. When the missiles have been stopped (by either means), the level is complete and you continue on to the next, more difficult round.</story>

Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</story>

				<story>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</story>

				<story>Q*bert is a conversion of the popular arcade game. The goal is to change all of the tiles on a pyramid to the target color. To do this you guide Q*bert around the pyramid, and every tile he hops on will change color. On early levels, a single hop will change the tile to the desired color, but on later levels you may need to hop on a tile multiple times or even avoid hopping on a tile multiple times! Trying to stop Q*bert are many different creatures which wander around the board, including Coily the snake, Slick and Sam, and falling balls. On the edge of the board are floating discs; if Q*bert jumps on one of these discs when the snake is in pursuit, the snake will fall off  the board while Q*bert is safely transported to the top.</story>

				<story>You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</story>

				<story>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</story>

There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starships energy; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shield, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the Krylon that are visible on your galactic map have been destroyed, you win this round and can advance in rank (or even be demoted if you performed poorly on a mission).  The games difficulty will gradually increase as you rise in rank from ships cook up to captain.</story>

The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</story>

When all asteroids are destroyed, the play can them move to the next round. In addition to asteroid, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.****The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.****Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed.. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. ****Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.****Game Difficulty and Variations**There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. ****The game also offers three different game variations:****1. Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.****2. Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.****3. Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both players are combined.****Scoring**The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen, while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new reserve ship for every 10,000 points.****1. Small saucer - 1,000 points**2. Other player's ship - 500 points**3. Large saucer - 200 points**4.

A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.****The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. ****The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.****Scoring****Close-in goals - 1 point**Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points**OTH shots - 3 points**Players may steal points from each other by making goals. **The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.**A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically</story>

				<story>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. ****The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. ****Insect Opponents and Mushrooms**All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:****1. The Centipede**The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.****Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.****The Spider**The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.****The Flea**The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.****The Scorpion**The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.****Mushrooms**Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes for shots to complete destroy a mushroom. There are two type of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.****Game Difficulty and Variations**The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:****1. One Player**Two Player Alternating**Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.**Dual Player Competition**Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.**Team Play**Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.****Scoring**The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:****Centipede Head - 100 points**Centipede Body Segment - 10 points**Spider at close range - 900 points**Spider at medium range - 600 points**Flea - 200 points**Scorpion - 1,000 points**Flea - 200 points**Restored mushroom - 5 points**Destroyed mushroom - 1 points</story>

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited.

Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.****Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story.  It should also be noted that in versions of the game for early 1980's consoles, Donkey Kong only used 2-3 of the original levels, with the cement factory usually omitted."</story>

As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.****Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.****Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.****In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.****Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.</story>

				<story>Pebbele Beach and St. Andrews are two of the courses on offer in this golf simulation, released in the early years of 16-bit technology.

You can also choose between regular and professional tees - in the latter option the distance on the holes is longer, and the computer doesn't choose the best club automatically. Because long drives aren't a crucial aspect of many of the holes, the Begginer/Expert setting is a bigger factor on your likely scoring.

Using the light gun, you need to shoot and destroy the various particles  before the control rods are destroyed. As the control rods take damage, the walls of the reactor will slowly cave inward, decreasing the amount of space available. From time to time power crystals may appear; if shot, these will provide bonuses such as extra points, control rod repair, temporarily freeze the particles, more powerful shots, and more.

To do this, a glowing orb called the Sentinel has been sent which can absorb the alien energy. As the Sentinel floats above the various, scrolling landscapes, you need to protect it from attacks by using the light gun to destroy enemies and enemy fire. If you don't destroy an enemy, it will deplete the Sentinels energy supply which will eventually destroy it. There are four levels of increasing difficulty, each with a large boss at the end. To help out on your mission, several bonuses may be encountered from time to time; increased firepower and energy can be acquired when you shoot the bonus capsules that appear.

				<story>World Tour Racing is an F1-style racing game for the Jaguar CD system.  You guide a very fast car on road courses based on countries around the world.  ****The graphics in World Tour Racing feature fully 3D environments constructed with texture-mapped polygons.****The various game modes include a championship, single race, and arcade mode.  Championship mode consists of a 16 race season.  Single race is self-explanatory, and arcade mode is similar to championship mode, except that advancement to the next race is based whether or not you finish high enough in each race..</story>
